# Description: Module containing a handler class for the MQTT protocol for 
# Python and Mosquitto broker. The paho-mqtt module and the Mosquitto broker
# should already be installed.
# To test the module, simply run it.
# To install paho-mqtt module, visit https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/ and
# follow the given instructions.
# To install the Mosquitto broker, visit 
# http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/install-mosquitto-broker/ 
# and follow the given instructions.

    Class for handling MQTT protocol with the Mosquitto broker.
    
    MQTTHandler Class for handling connections and messagens using the MQTT 
    protocol with the Mosquitto broker. For example of use, checkout 
    the test() function at the end of this module.
